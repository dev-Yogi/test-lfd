Covering Top 40, Rock, Pop, Rap, Country, Alternative, Metal, R &amp; B, Grunge, Classics, etc. - you get the best songs from every channel on your radio dial. Known for their dead-on vocal impersonations, great harmonies and select sequencing (inspired by the creative genius of former keyboardist, Scot Davis), Lemon Fresh Day plays the songs the way you're used to hearing them. Entertaining Omaha, Lincoln, Ralston, Papillion, La Vista, Fremont, Bellevue, Central Nebraska, and North &amp; Western Iowa, Lemon Fresh Day is now one of the most popular and recognizable names in live cover music in the Midwest, packing venues near and far (and posting new photos every week as proof)!!!
