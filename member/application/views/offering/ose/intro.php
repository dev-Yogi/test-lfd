                        <p>The purpose of Omaha STEM Ecosystem Best Practices Program Assessment Tool is to provide STEM programs in the Omaha-metropolitan area a tool to determine if they are providing a quality program.</p>
                        <p>The Omaha STEM Ecosystem Best Practices Program Assessment Tool is designed to evaluate the infrastructure, goals, programming, and STEM practices that programs should have in place to be considered a quality STEM program. This tool is for STEM programs of any size and serving any demographic. Evaluation is focused not only on best practice program elements but also implementation approaches. Results from this evaluation should be considered a starting point for assessment and planning and as a non-judgmental resource. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is an internal evaluation tool</span> focusing on best practices as identified by the Omaha STEM Ecosystem, and is not meant to be used as an instrument to compare your program to other STEM programs. This tool is a starting point for evaluation and can be used in conjunction with other program guidelines and tools.</p>
                        <p>To complete this evaluation, review each item and mark if your program demonstrates this goal as Developing or Proficient. Developing is considered the minimum evidence needed to be considered a quality STEM program. For items in which neither Developing nor Proficient are marked, an action plan is encouraged to begin working on those goals. Items in bold are considered high priority and should be addressed with urgency.</p>
                        <p>Consider the results of your evaluation in line with your program&rsquo;s stage of development; newer programs may score lower than mature programs. After completion of the evaluation, program leadership should develop an action plan to enhance the quality of your STEM program.</p>
